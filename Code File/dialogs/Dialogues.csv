while going to the bathroom."

find it anywhere. Let me borrow 
your phone quick, I’ll try 
and call it. Friend 2: Sure."

after no luck I used my friend’s phone to call mine. 
After two rings someone answered, 
gave out a low raspy giggle, and hung up."
"Friend 1: Someone has my phone as that 
someone picked up the call.
 But aren’t answering. "
"They didn’t answer again. I eventually
 gave up as a lost cause and headed home. I found 
my phone laying on my nightstand, right where I left it."
I was shocked to see it there!!
"Friend 1: Dude, I left it on my nightstand when I left.
Friend 2: then who the hell picked up your 
call from my phone."

tenants we came to know that a family 
of three lived here, a little boy with his parents."

"Friend 2: Guys I have to say something, 
last night was a horrific experience for me.

"Friend 2: Last night I went to sleep, after some time 
I felt something heavy on my chest, something 
that was moving. I tried waking up but couldn't,"
"I even tried calling you all it was like choking me. 
I couldn’t even move on my own. 
And now I woke up but still remember everything. "

There’s nothing like ghosts.Friend 2: 
Bro, please believe me, I am telling the truth."

ahead and opened the door it vanished."
"Friend 2: That’s scary dude, there’s really something 
wrong in this house. We must decide. 
Everyone’s mental peace has been robbed."
"At this moment we were all scared. 
It was our first time living alone in a new place, 
yet it was turning into a nightmare."
